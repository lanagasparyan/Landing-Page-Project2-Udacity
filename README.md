## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.


## Thoughts

This project improved my thinking and helped me to imagine how code works and what it does in each section. How active class adds and removes to HTML in realtime to an element and makes it interactive. 
Before this project I used to keep editing within the same code making it messy to read and understand later, now I start with trying first my approach on a smaller scale and then moving to the real project.
It is a good experience of understanding that the best way of making a project is to write the plan or logic on a paper and then all left is to translate it into a JavaScript or any other language.

## Description

This is a  landing page that uses Javascript to create a responsive  NavBar and sections onscroll. HTML, CSS and JS is used.
